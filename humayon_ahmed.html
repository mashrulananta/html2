       <h1>Humayun Ahmed</h1>

<blockquote><p><img src="humayon_ahmed.jfif" width="200"><i><b>Humayun Ahmed</b></i>, a native of Bangladesh, wore many hats during his lifetime. These include: filmmaker, screenwriter, playwright, author, teacher and dramatist. He was considered a cultural legend among native Bangladeshis. He was a man who followed his dreams, whether it was writing television plays or engaging young minds at the University of Dhaka. He was a large contributor to the world of fine arts and is often considered to be the Shakespeare of Bangladesh. During his time, he wrote more than 200 non-fiction and fiction books, all which were bestsellers in his homeland. Ahmed’s quirky characters, familiar content and simple language helped his fan base increase steadily. He wrote in a variety of different genres including suspense, romance, and paranormal thrillers. As Bangladesh’s best-selling author, he was idealized by men and women who grew up reading his books and watching his shows in the 1980s and 1990s. Although he was loved by most, he would often stir up controversy with his writings. In fact, Islamic preachers would often protest about the characters and what they stood for in his screen writings. Despite the large number of fans, the numerous awards, and becoming a household name, Ahmed was humble and did not consider himself to be a great writer.</p></blockquote>
